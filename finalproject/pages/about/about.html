    <h1>Ambiguity Tolerance</h1>
    <section class="about-text">
        <p>Experiments in Abstraction is an exercise aimed at improving ambiguity tolerance. Ambiguity refers to a lack of clarity or pertinent information, a sense of vagueness. Ambiguity tolerance is our ability to make decisions and adapt in uncertain or unclear situations. This lower-order personality trait significantly influences how we respond to and manage diverse circumstances.</p>
        <p>Individuals with higher ambiguity tolerance tend to exhibit greater confidence, curiosity, and creativity. They are more open to complex ideas, demonstrate stronger leadership skills, and maintain positive attitudes toward unfamiliar situations. In contrast, intolerance of ambiguity is often linked to rigidity, authoritarian tendencies, heightened anxiety, and stress.</p>
        <p>How can we increase our tolerance for ambiguity? Research shows that engaging in creative thinking can increase ambiguity tolerance. Experiments in Abstraction is designed to expose participants to experimental artwork and inspire abstract creation, fostering the skills needed to navigate ambiguity with confidence and creativity.</p>
